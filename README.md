# phd_thesis_code_and_data

Online Learning of Personalised Human Activity Recognition Models from User-Provided Annotations

This repository complements my PhD thesis and it contains the following:
(1) the code used to analyse the data and compile the graphs in my thesis,
(2) the code for the mobile apps (two versions) used to collect data from a panel of volunteer participants in our user study
and (3) the data collected from the user study.

The thesis is self-contained, so details about the code or the dataset can be found there.
